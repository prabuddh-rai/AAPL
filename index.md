# APPL Inc Stock

This project is based on the stock prices of shares. I had a keen inetrest in stock market and I decided to analyze the time series of closing values of APPL inc stock for past 5 years. The time series can be treated as a univariate and multivariate too. In the initial phase I used LSTM to solve univariate time series. 
The dataset was obtained from NASDAQ for the past 5 years till 28th May 2021. The repository contains the dataset and recently updated jupyter notebook.

## Future Work
Updating the jupyter notebook for including more variables in the model.
Updating the dataset to analyse other stocks.
